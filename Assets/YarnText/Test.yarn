I go outside, but what do I do then?
-> Something
	Searching for something 
	I get out of bed and walk around at night, aimlessly in search of a nothingness that I once had. Something or someone that can tame the mind and put me to sleep.
	The therapy of nothingness became a minefield of somethings as I grew up and everything got heavier. The question of what to do tomorrow and the reflection of what I did today keeps me up and unready for the paths ahead. 
	Each path is an endless dead-end I find myself halfway down in both directions.
-> Nothing
	Nothing
